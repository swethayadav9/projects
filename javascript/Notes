JAVASCRIPT is called the language of web. it is the programming language for web development.
JS is used for fnctioning of the website.
JS is actually maintained by Ecma script.we are currently in ES153 but popular is ES6.
JS files used extension .JS
you can add internal JAVASCRIPT or external JS.

For  Internal JS ==> you can write JS inside script tag.
java and JS are not related at all. 1994==>Livescript==>javascript because java is popular.
<script>
    //internal
    </script>

//external 
<script src=" ./file">
</script>
ques
1.how to write comments in JS?
Comments are used for better understanding and readability.
there are two types pf comments in JS.
1.single line--
//comment
2.multi line--
/* comment*/

ques2.what are essential to know for a programming language?
1.variable
2.data types
3.operators
4.controls
5.loops

ques3.what is a variable? how to declare one?
variables are used to store the data. In JS,there are three ways to declare a variable
1.var variable-name;
2.let variable-name;
3.const variable-name;
let const are ES6 features

ques4.what are the basic widow methods?
There are three basic window methods.
1.alert()--used to print some info as an alert.
2.prompt()--used to ge input for user
3.confirm()--it will ask you to conform

ques5.what are the different data types in JS?
Data Types defines what type the data belobgs.There are primirily two types 
1.primitive data types:
primitive data types are used to define any data .they are number,string,boolean,null,undefined.
2.non-primitive data types:
They use primitive data type.these are aksi called referenace data types.
arrays,objects,functions.

Basically JS is used duck typing or dynamic data typing means you cant fix one data type for one variable

To know the data type of a variable,you can use operator "typeof()"

ques6.Explain 'number' data type.
any numerical values in JS , it automaticaly assigns number data type. Even decimals are also considered as number data type.
  There are some pre-defined methods for numbers
  1.var num= 25.365;
  num.toFixed(2)--> it will round figure number into 2 decimal points.
  2.var num=26.369;
  num.to presicion(3)--> it will round figure number into only 3 digits from starting.
  3.var num=25;
  num.toString(2)-->it will convert the given number into respect base number-->numinto binary.



----------------MATH METHODS--------
Math methods are default methods used for specific mathamatical operations.
some of the Math methods are:
1.Math.sqr(num)-->returns the squae root of num
2.Math.cbrt(num)-->returns the cube root of num
3.Math.pow(x,y)-->returns the result of x power y
4.Math.log(x)-->returns logarithemic value of x
5.Math.exp(x)-->returns result of e power x
6.Math.ceil(x)-->give the largest near possible number in decimal number line
7.Math.floor(x)-->given the smallest neat possible number in decimal number line
8.Math.round(num)-->will round figure the value of num
9.Math.random()-->will generate random valu from 0.0 to 1.0
10.Math.max(x,y) and Math.min(x,y)-->will genetate maximum values from given values
11.Math.abs(-x)-->will remove the negitivity and print results



--------------------STRING METHODS------------------
String are used for alphanumerics.Strings can be represented inJS by three ways
1.Single quotes:
var s='swetha';
2.double quotes:
var s="annaya";
There is no difference  for single quote and double quote based ob requirement we will use and better maintain consistency
3.Template literal:
it takes the vaues without breaking flow
 var str='the value is ${x}'

 METHODS:
 str.length-->return the length of the string(no.of characters)
 Eg:"the is js cource"-->18 char
 str.touppercase()-->will convert str into Uppercase
 str.tolowercase()-->will convert str into Lowercase
 Eg:"swetha".toUpperCase()-->SWETHA
 "SWETHA".toLowerCase()-->swetha
 str.slice('start','end')-->will reurn piece of str from start (inculded) index to end (excluded) index
 "swetha".slice(2,5)-->eth

 str.substr(start) or str.substr(start,length):
 -->will return from start to end of string or from start to length 
 "swetha".substr(1)-->wetha
 "swetha".substr(1,3)-->wet

 str.endsWith('x') or str.startWith('x')-->check whether str is ending with x or not 
 /str is starting with  x or not-->return tuue or false
 "swetha".endsWith('ha')-->true

 str.split('deliiter')-->used to split the characters based on delimitor "swe tha".split(' ')-->["swe tha"]

 str.join('delimiter')-->joins the array of values based on delimiter 
 ["swe"," tha"].join(' ')-->"swe tha"

 str.indexOf('char')-->returns the index of specific character "swetha".indexOf('a')
 -->2-->always returns first occurence for last occurence-->lastIndexOf
