In JS , functions are called as first class citizens.

functions are understand by 3 things 
 function declaration
 function definition
 function call

 The main uses of functions are reusability, split the code.

 function function-name(parametrs)-->declaration
 {
    //code --> body/def
 }
 function-name(arguments) -->calling

 function incre(a)
 {
    console.log(++a)
 }
 incre(5)

Every function also be stored as a variable by default with same name
console.log(incre)--> it will print whole function

you can also give name like function expression

var xyz= function incre()
{
    console.log("something")
}
console.log(xyz)--> will print whole function.
 you can even remove name and call the function as anonymous function

 callback functions:
 writing or taking one function as aparameter to another function is called call back function

the function which is taking is called Higher order function

the function which is in parameter is called callback function

------intro.txt-------------
JAVASCRIPT is called the language of Web. it is the programming language for web development.
JS is used for functioning of the website.
JS is actually maintained by Ecma script.we are currently in ES13 but popular is ES6.
JS files used extension .JS
you can add internal JAVASCRIPT or external JS.

For Internal JS ==> you can write JS inside script tag. 

Java and JS are not related at all. 1994==>Livescript==>javascript bcz java is popular.


<script>
//internal
</script>

//external
<script src="./file></script>

1. how to write comments in JS?
Comments are used for better understanding and readability. There are two types pf comments in JS.
1. single line -- 
// comment 
2.multi line --
/* .......................
...................*/

2. what are essential to know for a programming language?
1. variable
2.data types
3.operators
4. controls
5.loops

3. what is variable? how to declare one?

variables are used to store the data. In JS, there are three ways to declare a variable
1. var variable-name;
2. let variable-name;
3.const variable-name;
 let,const are ES6 features
3. what are the basics window methods?
There are three baic window methods.
1. alert() -- used to print some info as an alert.
2.propmpt() -- used to get input from user but it will always take as a string
3.confirm() -- it will ask you to confirm yes or no?
/* comment  */

4. what are the different data types in JS?
Data type defines what type the data belongs. There are primirily two types. 
  1. primitive data types:
  primitive data types are used to define any data.They are
     number, string, boolean , null , undefined
  2. non- primitive data types: They use primitive data type. These are also called reference data types.
     arrays,objects,functions

 Basically JS used duck typing or dynamic data typing means you can't fix one data type for one variable.    

 To know the data type of a variable, you can use operator "typeof()"

 5. Explain 'number' data type.
  any numerical values in Js , it automatically assigns number data type. Even decimals are also considered as number data type .

  There are some pre - defined methods for numbers
    1. var num=25.369;
    num.toFixed(2)---> it will round figure number into 2 decimal points.
    2. var num=26.3698
    num.toPrecision(3) ---> it will round figure number into only 3 digits from starting
    3.var num=25;
    num.toString(2) --> it will convert the given number into respected base number--> num into binary


    --------------------loops---------------------


    loops or iteration statements:
they run until the condition fails. each run is one iteration.

They are primirily two loops existed. 
1. entry control loops:
at entry only the condition will be checked
Eg: while, for
2. exit control loops:
condition will be checked after execution
Eg: do while

initialization; i=0
while(condition) i<10
{
    //code i
    updation i++
}


initalization
do{
    code
    updation
}while(condition)

//for loops
//standard for
for(initialization;condition;updation)
{
    //code
}
