          <p>Start by connecting your iPad to its Power Adapter and allow the iPad to charge for at least an hour. This step is advised as a battery with very low charge, or is failing, may produce symptoms that emulate a boot loop.



            If the problem fails to stabilise after an hour, whilst still connected to the Power Adapter, attempt a forced restart of the iPad:
            
            
            
            On an iPad with a Home button: Press and hold the top button and the Home button at the same time. When the Apple logo appears, release both buttons.
            On other iPad models: Press and quickly release the volume up button, press and quickly release the volume down button, then press and hold the top button. When the Apple logo appears, release the button.</p>
