Just understand how css works
CSS: cascading style sheets. these are used to include styling/designing into Web pages.
There are three ways to achieve CSS.
1. Inline: Inline css means in the line of html element, style will applied as a attribute.
<h1 style="color:red">something</h1> 
2. Internal: Internal styling means apply style as a element
<style>
   selector{
    property-name:value;
   }
</style>
/* selectors can be directly tagnames like h1,div etc.., or classname like 
.class1 , .class2 etcc., or id names like #id1,#id2 etc..,

3. External CSS:
 We can write css in separate file with dot css extension and link that css into html file
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="link" />
