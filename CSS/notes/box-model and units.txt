CSS units and the box model are fundamental concepts in web development, as they dictate how elements are sized and spaced within a webpage. Let's dive into each concept in detail:

CSS Units:
Absolute Units:

Pixels (px): Represents a single dot on a screen. It is a fixed-size unit that does not change with the screen size or resolution.

div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
}
Relative Units:

Percentage (%): Relative to the parent element's size.

div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
}
Viewport Width/Height (vw/vh): Relative to the viewport's width or height.

div {
  width: 50vw;
  height: 50vh;
}
Font-relative Lengths (em, rem): Relative to the font size of the element or the root element (html).

div {
  font-size: 1.2em; /* 1.2 times the parent element's font size */
  margin: 1rem; /* 1 times the root element's font size */
}
Viewport Percentage (vmin, vmax): Relative to the smaller or larger dimension of the viewport.

div {
  width: 50vmin; /* 50% of the viewport's smaller dimension */
  height: 50vmax; /* 50% of the viewport's larger dimension */
}
Other Units:

Centimeters (cm), Millimeters (mm), Inches (in): Absolute physical units.
Points (pt), Picas (pc): Typically used in print.
Box Model:
The box model describes how elements are rendered on a webpage, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.

Content: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.


div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
}
Padding: Space between the content and the border.


div {
  padding: 20px;
}
Border: A border surrounding the padding and content.


div {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
Margin: Space outside the border, separating this element from other elements.


div {
  margin: 10px;
}
Example:
Let's say we have a <div> element with a width of 200px, padding of 20px, border of 2px, and margin of 10px. The total width of the box will be calculated as follows:

Width Calculation:
Total width = width + (left padding) + (right padding) + (left border) + (right border) + (left margin) + (right margin)
Total width = 200px + (20px * 2) + (2px * 2) + (10px * 2)
Total width = 200px + 40px + 4px + 20px
Total width = 264px
Similarly, the total height will be calculated considering the height, padding, border, and margin in a similar manner.

To avoid this make width height constant, we use, box-sizing:border-box;
