             <h2>Early Life</h2>
             <p>Rani Lakshmibai (or Rani Lakshmi Bai) was born on 19 November 1828 (some sources 
                say 1835)in the tow n of Banares (now Varanasi) into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin 
                family. She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu. Her father was
                 Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came
                  from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of
                   modern-day Maharashtra. Her mother died when she was five years old. Her father 
                   was a Commander during the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao
                    II of Bithoor district. The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "beautiful "
                     and "lively and cheerful". She was educated at home and was taught to read and write, 
                     and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included 
                     shooting, horsemanship, fencing and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana 
                     Sahib and Tantia Tope.[dubious – discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the
                      patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time. And she
                       was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social norms even 
                       in front of the whole society.<br><br>

                Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the
                palace and the temple, although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin. Her horses
                 included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according to historians, she rode Baadal when escaping 
                 from the fort in 1858. Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been converted into a museum.
                  It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th 
                  centuries AD.</p>
                  <h2>History of Jhansi in 1842 to 1857</h2>
                  <p>Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 
                    1842[3][18] and was afterward called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honor of the Hindu 
                    goddess Devi Lakshmi and according to the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given 
                    a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave birth to a boy, later named
                     Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth due to a chronic illness. The Maharaja
                      adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed
                      Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died.The adoption was in the presence
                       of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing
                        that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be
                         given to his widow for her lifetime.

                    After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao)
                     was an adopted son, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied 
                     the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its 
                     territories. When she was informed of this she cried out "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi" 
                    (I shall not surrender my Jhansi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was given an annual pension
                     of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.
                    
                    According to Vishnu Bhatt Godse, the Rani would exercise at weightlifting, wrestling,
                     and steeplechasing before breakfast. An intelligent and simply-dressed woman, she ruled in a
                     businesslike manner.</p>
